# CollabrativeBasedRecommendationSystem
In Collaborative Filtering, we tend to find similar users and recommend what similar users like. In this type of recommendation system, we don't use the features of the item to recommend it, rather we classify the users into clusters of similar types and recommend each user according to the preference of its cluster.
